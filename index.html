  <p class="byline">By Janice Ha</p>


  <p>When the year 2020 is brought up in conversations, mostly everyoneâ€™s mind goes immediately to the deadly virus that took over the world. The Covid-19 pandemic was a detrimental part of life, affecting everyone in various ways whether it was financially, physically, and/or socially. One aspect of the pandemic that most people can agree on is that the quarantine raised feelings of depression and loneliness. As everyone was forced to stay inside and isolate themselves, it was easy for individuals to get stuck in a pattern of feeling alone and hopeless. </p>

<p>A Covid-19 Impact Survey shows how individuals across the United States responded to feeling depressed or lonely in a seven-day span.</p>

<p>The maps show that the Northeast had the least amount of people who responded with feeling depressed or lonely in the past three-seven days. The maps also show that the South had the most respondents stating they had felt depressed or lonely in the past three to seven days. A reason for this is because in many cities such as New York City, it can be harder to stay away from having an active life versus those who live in suburban towns where it is easier to just stay indoors. </p>

<p>The pandemic brought many significant changes to everyday life including social distancing and isolation. During this time, many people experienced feelings of stress, anxiety, sadness, fear, and loneliness. The causes of this could be due to the increased dependence on technology and social media as a result from the pandemic, leading to a decrease in face-to-face interactions.</p>

<p>Results from the survey also showed the number of people who responded in feeling depressed in a given seven day span based on the amount of people in the household. Obviously, as shown, people who live alone have the highest amount of respondents feeling depressed during the Covid-19 pandemic. This is due to feeling stuck in an enclosed place without any in-person interactions.</p>

<p>Another aspect shown from the survey was how often people communicated with friends and family by phone, text, email, social media app, etc before and during the pandemic. Results show that more people communicated with others via online during the pandemic compared to before.</p>

<p>A way that many people have dealt with feelings of loneliness and depression during the pandemic was getting a pet, specifically a dog. This is shown heavily through pet therapy. According to Polly Heavenrich, whose dog, Moury, is a therapy dog believes that pet therapy has scientifically proven to have benefits in improving mental health and in decreasing blood pressure.</p>

<p>Another way groups of people have felt less lonely during the quarantine is by scheduling group calls with friends and/or family, especially for important events such as holidays and birthdays.</p>
